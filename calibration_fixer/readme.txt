The L and R sliders don't have a central resting position. This
will cause many games to think they are active, which causes
problem when performing button assignments. 

The tool provided here patches the calibration data in a way
that makes the idle position appear central to the computer.
Execute it _after_ completing the normal windows calibration
procdure. 

You need to run the patch again every time you recalibrate
using the windows tool.
